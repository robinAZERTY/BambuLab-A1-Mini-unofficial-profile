Some tips I personally use for a better experience of my A1 mini.
I love my A1 mini, but there are a few things I would like to share for a better experience.

## ✅ Objectives
The first objective I would like to achieve is to improve the starting process by reducing the noise and the time it takes.
In addition, I would like to show that you can print multiple colors without AMS, by manually changing the filament during the print.

## 📦 Materials
- A1 Mini without AMS, with some minor accessories prints.

- BambuStudio

## 📝 Steps
Changes to made are only in the slicer, in the user's presets, in start, end, and filament change G-code. You can use the rest of the settings as you wish.

### 📄 Disclaimer
I personally use these settings and I am happy with the results. However, If you decide to use them, you do so at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by the changes made to the printer.
